# xAPI Data from ILT - a reveal.js presentation

This presentation was developed initially in the context of Torrance Learning's xAPI Cohort, spring 2018, for the project established by team-ilt-xapi.

For ease of use, this repository contains the whole `reveal.js` code. The presentation is entirely contained in the `index.html` file.

To see the presentation, just open the `index.html` file in your browser.
